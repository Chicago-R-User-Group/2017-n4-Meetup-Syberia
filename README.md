A talk with Robert Krzyzanowski on how R is being used in production by one of the fastest-growing online consumer lenders in the world.

Syberia is a framework designed to productionize the R programming language, for both the development and deployment of machine learning models.  By incorporating R into a single end-to-end machine learning processes, the team at Avant is able to rapidly improve the company's underwriting, fraud detection, collections activity, and lead conversion analysis.

Rob is the original creator of Syberia, and he is the current director of data engineering at Avant, an online consumer lender that launched in 2012 and crossed the $1B threshold in 2015. Rob's previous experience includes studying pure mathematics at the University of Illinois at Chicago as well as B.S. in math, computer science and physics. Conditional on his spare time, the likelihood is high you'll find Rob playing chess and drinking black mango tea!
